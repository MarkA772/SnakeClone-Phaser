# SnakeClone-Phaser
*An old Snake clone I made in 2018*

## Summary
I figured I should post some of these old projects up on my github to show how I've improved over the years.

I had made an app in vanilla JS for practice using HTML Canvas already, so decided I would try my hand at using a javascript game library, Phaser. And what better first project than the classic Snake.

Unlike the usual Snake, this one is not divided into a grid, which offered some interesting and fun challenges, such as making sure you couldn't turn in on yourself.

### Bugs
# 
Some collision issues I never had the chance to get to. I'm not even sure I noticed it back then. And the food can spawn on the snake's tail.
